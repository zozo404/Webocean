# Webocean
Welcome to my new site Webocean ðŸ‘‹

Personal project which aims to train me to create a commercial site with Nuxt2, TailwindCSS, Sanity, Stripe technologies. I haven't put the payment links yet (test mode). The form is just figurative. A carousel is coming in _slug/product to display multiple images

Access: [Webocean.netlify.app](https://Webocean.netlify.app)
## Installation

```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/zozo404/Webocean.git

$ cd Webocean

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# If that doesn't work, check if the node version is = 18.14
$ nvm list
$ nvm use 18.14

```
ðŸ”Œ Data is stored on Sanity
